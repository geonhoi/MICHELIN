                    What's the first Korean food that comes to mind when you hear the term “rice thief?” Now used to describe a wide variety of dishes, the word originally refers to ganjang-gejang or soy sauce marinated crab.

            <p>
                There are various theories on its origin. Although first mentioned in a 17th-century book covering the diet and recipes of the Joseon Dynasty, this folk dish has an even longer history and has remained one of the country's representative fermented dishes.
            </p>
            <p>
                An abundant harvest of blue crabs and diverse local ingredients, coupled with the advancement of food preservation, has helped Korea's southwestern coastal region develop a range of crab marinating recipes. A transition from salt marination to soy sauce marination has allowed ganjang-gejang to become a popular national food.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following are Michelin Restaurants in Seoul, each offering its own version of soy sauce marinated crab with uniquely Korean flavors, accompanied by laver, green laver, and rice, the culinary soulmates of the dish.

                    Although Korea, China, and Japan are geographically close, they have different food cultures. Here are some of the restaurants that serve rice dishes from East Asia that can be tasted in Korea.

            <hr>
            <p>
                Ts neighboring countries, Korea, China, and Japan share a similar food culture, but there are considerable distinctions among all three nations in terms of recipes. For instance, they all use rice as their staple food, but the type of rice and the way it is prepared vary greatly across these countries.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Korea, rice is the staple dish. However, in China, where meals consist of fan (rice) and cai (side dish), cai or a main dish is eaten before a rice dish, so rice is part of a course meal and not a main dish. As for Japan, although its cuisine shares many attributes with its Korean counterpart, rice tends to be approached more as an ingredient for sushi or maki.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following three eateries offer the three countries' representative rice dishes that are related yet noticeably distinct.ary soulmates of the dish.

                <p>Bibimbap is a representative Korean dish, where a wide array of vegetables, seasonings, and condiments are interspersed in harmony to create a synergy of flavors. According to history, the dish was originally known as goldongban. Bibimbap is the very epitome of ordinary Korean cuisine although there are regional and seasonal variations in ingredients and tastes. In particular, the kind temptingly garnished with herbs and vegetables in various colors and served in a brass bowl is referred to as kkotbap, or flower rice, as it evokes the image of a pot adorned with flowers. The bibimbap dish served at A Flower Blossom on the Rice welcomes guests with its aesthetic appearance, where rice and seasoned greens are wrapped in a yellow omelet like a gift wrapped in a wrapping cloth. On top of this, the use of organic ingredients makes the nourishment offered up even more pleasing to the palate.</p>

                <p>In Chinese cuisine, the history of fried rice dates back more than 2,000 years. Chao fan, or fried rice, is the most common Chinese dish. The key to tasty chao fan is to ensure that the rice grains do not stick together. Dubbed the “godfather of the Korean-Chinese food industry,” Chef Wang Yuk-sung has created a dish known as XO Fried Rice imbued with his many years of culinary experience. Rice, seafood, and vegetables fried with his custom-made XO sauce; their seemingly plain yet well-balanced flavor and aroma; and rice grains that pop in your mouth all reflect the chef's culinary virtuosity. That may explain why fried rice is always on the menu.</p>

                Gaon (Chef Kim Byung jin) and Mosu (Chef Ahn Sung jae) have been awarded Michelin's highest rating of three stars, which means "a restaurant whose cuisine is so good that it is worth making a special trip to taste it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gaon, an upscale Korean restaurant, has been honored with three stars for seven consecutive years since 2016 (2017 edition), when Michelin Korea published its first guidebook in Korea. In a cozy and elegant space, Gaon serves traditional Korean flavors uniquely interpreted by Chef Byung Jin Kim. The restaurant stands out for its intuitive presentation of ingredients in exceptional dishes. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Mosu has garnered attention for its new status as a three-star restaurant this year, up from a two-star Michelin restaurant last year. Chef Ahn Sungjae presents each dish with an original idea during the meal and The excellent hospitality service to go along with the fabulous food is also among the best in Seoul. The steady, year-over-year improvement in the quality of our Mosu has been a source of deep confidence for our customers.

                <p>Gaon, which means "center," opened with the motto of creating a standard for Korean cuisine. Just as French cuisine has a set menu and Japanese cuisine has kaiseki cuisine, he felt there should be a standard for Korean course flow. After thinking long and hard about how to present Korean food, he came to the conclusion that it should focus on good ingredients. Rather than combining various ingredients, he focused on capturing the full flavor of a single ingredient. Natural food that emphasizes process over finesse. In line with the concept of a home within a home, the interior was designed with careful attention to the lighting and materials that are most comfortable for the eyes. Gaon is proving that Korean food can be a holistic dining experience with refined and delicate processes. Chef Kim Byung-jin was walking forward, leaving footprints in the pure white snow that no one else had ever trodden.</p>

                Gukbap, or hot soup with rice, is a type of Korean cuisine that consists of a soup with rice that is then rolled up. It can be served with or without rice, depending on your preference. There are several reasons for not rolling the rice from scratch, including the fact that the starch of the rice spreads in the soup, which can make the soup lose its crispness, and hygienic reasons.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are several theories about the etymology and origin of Gukbap, but no one knows exactly when it began.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alternatively, it is speculated that Gukbap may have been a quick and easy-to-eat meal that was adapted for use in lodges and restaurants as warriors traveled long distances to save time, store luggage, and eat a simple, quick meal. This theory is similar to the origin of the hamburger in Germany.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many types of Gukbap, but the one we're going to introduce you to today is Dwaeji-gukbap(pork soup). Let's try Dwaeji-gukbap in Seoul.

                <p>The restaurant's clean white signage says it all. Chef Park Chan-il's dwaeji-gukbap or pork and rice soup looks and tastes unadulterated. Prepared simply by boiling black pork ham and Duroc pork shoulder cuts, the clear broth is fragrant and profoundly flavorful. Although ‘gukbap' is commonly served with rice already mixed into the hot soup, Park serves the two separately, to preserve the taste of freshly steamed rice. The heaping of chopped chives added to the soup just before it is served renders the broth wonderfully aromatic.</p>

                <p>With his take on dwaeji-gukbap, Chef Ok Dong-sik has managed to singlehandedly change any preconceptions the local diners previously had about the hearty pork and rice soup dish Koreans hold near and dear to their hearts. Think bacon-thin slices of silky tender pork meat piled on a bed of rice, all submerged in his trademark consommé-like clear broth. The 'extra large' portion comes with double the amount of meat. The space is limited and only 100 bowls of gukbap are sold daily so get here early.</p>
