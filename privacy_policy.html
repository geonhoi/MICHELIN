                - About Data Security
                <p class="ral5w14">
                    Michelin has implemented measures to protect the privacy, security and integrity of your personal data. Access to personal data is restricted to those employees and service providers who need to know this information and who have been trained to comply with rules on confidentiality.
                </p>
                <p class="ral5w14">
                    On Michelin's commercial sites, banking information will be collected by an authorized payment service provider for the purposes of effective, legal secure payment processes. These measures may consist of SSL encryption (intended to make the data unreadable to others) during the collection or transfer of confidential data. Said information will be used only for purposes of online payment and will not be retained.
                </p>
                <p class="ral5w14">
                    Michelin ensures that your personal data are not altered, damaged or accessed by unauthorised third parties.
