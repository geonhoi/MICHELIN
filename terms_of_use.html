                1. Information about us
                <p>
                    Welcome to the Guide.michelin.com website (the “Website”) or mobile application (the “Application”).

                </p>
                <p>
                    The restaurant table booking service available on our Website and Application (the “Booking Service”) is also provided by us, through a third party service provider (the “Booking
                    Partner”) and on behalf of restaurants with whom you are booking a table (a “Restaurant”).
                </p>
                <p>
                    These “Terms of Use” set out the terms of use on which you may make use of our Website and our Application, and the services we provide. In addition, certain features in relation with

                        - if you are a restaurant owner who wishes to list your Restaurant on the Website and the Application and make it bookable, then you will have a separate contractual relationship

                5. Booking Service
                <p>
                    You agree to fully cooperate with us to investigate any suspected or actual activity that is in breach of these Terms of Use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The dining services which you book via the Booking Service are provided to you by the Restaurant directly and not by Michelin. Therefore, by using the Booking Service to book a table 
                    at your chosen Restaurant you are entering into a direct contract with that Restaurant and Michelin is not a party to that contract and has no obligations to you under that contract.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to make any booking using the Booking Service you must have the legal capacity to do so and you must accept financial responsibility for all transactions made under your 
                    name. You must make sure that all the information you provide to us is true and accurate. Booking a table at the Restaurant means you have to pay the Restaurant after you have eaten 
                    unless it is clearly indicated before you book that you have to prepay in advance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you use the Booking Service to place a booking at the Restaurant you are making an offer to the Restaurant for your booking. Your booking is not complete nor legally binding on 
                    the Restaurant until such time as you have received a confirmatory email from the Restaurant accepting your booking. Please ensure that you arrive in plenty of time and bring a copy 
                    of your email booking confirmation. If you have prepaid in advance please also bring the credit/debit card you used to make the booking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you wish to cancel your booking you can use the hypertext link in the confirmation email or contact the Restaurant directly. Contact details and any applicable cancellation policy for 
                    the Restaurant can be found in the confirmation email.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some Restaurants levy a 'no-show' fee for failure to attend the Restaurant at the reserved time. If the Restaurant operates such a policy you will be asked by us for your credit card 
                    details at the time of making the booking via the Booking Service. We will securely store those details in accordance with our Privacy Policy. The decision whether to debit your card with
                    a cancellation fee or 'no-show' fee is entirely at the discretion of the Restaurant and we will only action that fee if instructed to do so by the Restaurant. If you believe that a no-show fee
                    has been incorrectly deducted from your credit card you should Contact Us using the addresses given at the end of these Terms of Use. On receipt of all relevant information from you 
                    we will take up the matter with the Restaurant and if in our opinion the Restaurant has not followed its stated terms and conditions at the time of booking we will facilitate a refund.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some Restaurants levy a 'pre-payment' for some or all of the expected dining costs. If the Restaurant operates such a policy you will be asked by us for your credit card details at the 
                    time of making the booking via the Booking Service to enable a pre-payment to be made. We will securely store those details in accordance with our Privacy Policy. If you believe that a
                    pre-payment has been incorrectly deducted from your credit card you should Contact Us using the addresses given at the end of these Terms of Use. On receipt of all relevant i
                    nformation from you we will take up the matter with the Restaurant and if in our opinion the Restaurant has not followed its stated terms and conditions at the time of booking we will 
                    facilitate a refund.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some restaurants offer/accept prepaid vouchers for some or all of the expected dining costs. If you are making a booking with such a prepaid voucher you will be asked by us at the 
                    time of making the booking via the Booking Service, for your unique voucher identification number. Once the unique voucher identification number is input and validated, and the 
                    booking is confirmed by the Restaurant, the booking is then subject to the Restaurant's cancellation policy. It is not possible to change a booking made using a prepaid voucher unless 
                    the Restaurant agrees to the change. If a booking cannot be altered by the Restaurant it will not be possible to issue a refund for the voucher. In the unlikely event that the Restaurant 
                    needs to cancel the booking after you have booked a date, they will contact you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We reserve the right to cancel a booking, but this of course will be without any liability on your part.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because your contract is directly with the Restaurant any queries or concerns that you may have in connection with your Restaurant table booking should be addressed directly to the 
                    Restaurant via the details set out in the confirmatory email.
                </p>
            </li>
